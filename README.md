# <h1 align="center"> Who I am </h1>

In 2019 I have made the decision to hang my apron and change my life by looking into learning how to
code. At the time, I did not even know about the existence of ‘GitHub’ and five months later, here I am, a
full stack junior developer (in the making). For years I have had a strong interest in technology, its
components and the way in which different parts work together. This has spurred an interest in coding,
as I sought to understand the work behind the scenes, how to find the source of a problem and fix it in a
methodological way. As a Makers graduate, I am seeking an opportunity to begin an exciting career while
furthering my knowledge of coding.

#### Team work and Adaptability.

- In Makers, we were put with different pairs every week as well as in the group projects
- I believe that teamwork is the most valuable as one can get more ideas from it and hear different opinions as well as getting good feedback. I am also able to adapt to every person and its needs.
